# Simple Run Environment

This is a minimal run environment that I set up to run the code in node.  I have enjoyed the simplicity of repl.it, but wanted it to run in the terminal.  Also I included a simple jest test file for test the code.

To open console in VSCode, use the commands `ctrl` + `.

You can run your code and tests with the follow commands:

`npm run start` and `npm run test`.
